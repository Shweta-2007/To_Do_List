# To_Do_List
Project Title: To-Do List App

Description:
The To-Do List App is a web-based application designed to help users manage their tasks and stay organized. Built using fundamental web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app provides a user-friendly interface for creating, tracking, and deleting tasks.

Key Features:

Task Management: Users can easily add new tasks to the list by typing the task description in the provided input field and clicking the "ADD" button.

Dynamic Task List: Tasks are displayed as a dynamic list in the user interface. The list items include a task description and a delete button for easy task removal.

Task Status: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on them. A "checked" visual indicator distinguishes completed tasks, making it convenient to track progress.

Local Storage: The app leverages the browser's local storage to retain task data. This means users can access their to-do list even after closing and reopening the app or refreshing the page.
